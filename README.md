# Marriage_Game - DESCRIPTION 
The program will make up the data and then display a town of 2N people, including each
person's preferences for the other people (in order, more preferred first) and also who they are
married to, if any, should be capitalized. The program then allows the user to marry people until everyone is happily married.

# THE RULES
1. Cheating can occur between two people who are not married to each other if they each like
each other more than their spouses.
2. For the game to end, everyone has to get married AND there's no cheating potential.
